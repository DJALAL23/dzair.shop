/**
 * The checkout's one answer: what the lines cost — offers, then the coupon —
 * and what delivering them there costs. The cart quote shows it and the
 * storefront order is checked against it before anything is written, so what
 * the shopper is shown is what the order charges.
 *
 * Order of the stages (ADR 0007): catalog prices → offers → coupon →
 * delivery. Delivery's rate is judged on the subtotal after the coupon, so a
 * discount can take a basket back under the free-delivery threshold, and a
 * free-delivery coupon with nothing to give — delivery already free — is
 * refused rather than spending a use.
