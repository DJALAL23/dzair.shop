/**
 * Which offers a basket earns, and what they do to it.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no clock. The catalog snapshot loads the candidates
 * (active, in schedule) with their tiers; the order engine and the cart quote
 * both call `applyOffers`, so what the shopper is shown and what the order
 * charges cannot drift apart.
 *
 * The rules, and why each one is what it is:
 *
 *  1. A product is judged by the units it counts: every line of it, across
 *     variants — two sizes of one shirt are two shirts — or only the variant
 *     an offer is locked to.
 *  2. One offer per product. An offer qualifies when its threshold is
 *     reached and it can give what it promises: a reward the stock covers
 *     (once the units paid for and the rewards placed before are counted),
 *     free delivery only where rule 5 allows it, a tier that changes the
 *     price or brings free delivery the basket can use — a tier at the
 *     catalog price gives nothing, and must not cost the shopper a coupon. Among those, the shopper's
 *     choice (`offerId`) wins when it qualifies on its own; else the highest
 *     threshold reached wins, the id breaking a tie so every run agrees. An
 *     offer that cannot give its benefit never shadows one that can.
 *  3. Quantity pricing prices the counted lines at the highest tier reached:
 *     exactly the tier's price at its quantity, its per-unit price beyond.
 *     The total is shared across the lines by their quantities so the lines
 *     add up to it to the dinar.
 *  4. A reward is given once per order, whatever the quantity. Rewards are output,
 *     never input: a reward unit never counts toward another offer.
 *  5. Free delivery — a free-shipping offer, or a tier that includes it —
 *     applies only to a basket of one product. In a mixed basket free delivery
 *     is the store's threshold's business; otherwise a cheap promoted item
 *     would ship a large basket for free.
 *  6. Only an offer that changed something is reported as applied, and every
 *     line it counted names it — a coupon never covers those lines.
 *  7. Products are judged in basket order, so a basket always comes out the
 *     same.
